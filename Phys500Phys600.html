      <!-- l. 8 --><p class='noindent'>Having  been  accepted  to  this  program,  I’m  sure  you  are  already
      sufficiently proficient in English to follow the course material (which
      is in English by the article 5/1 of <a href='https://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en/middle-east-technical-university-rules-and-regulations-governing-graduate-studies'>Regulations</a>). However, high energy
      and mathematical physics (and especially the branches that I work on)
      are very <span class='cmti-12'>dynamic </span>fields, meaning that a high volume of articles are
                                                                          

                                                                          
      constantly being published. Doing a Ph.D. studies with me will require
      you to read a lot of articles, something which would be rather heavy
      on you if your English is not on par.
      </p><!-- l. 10 --><p class='noindent'>At  the  end  of  the  day,  your  graduate  studies  should  be  something

      Thus, I highly advice you to check out <a href='https://arxiv.org/list/hep-th/new'>some articles in high energy
      theory</a> to see if you can easily follow them: it is perfectly okay not to
      be familiar with technical vocabulary (such as cohomology or moduli
      space), just make sure your inability to follow a paper (if any) has
      nothing to do with language!

   2. </dt><dd class='enumerate-enumitem'><span class='cmbx-12'>Make sure you really would like to work with me!</span><br class='newline' />It is of course important to work with someone who is proficient in their
      field, but what is even more important is to work with people that you
      can <span class='cmti-12'>get along with</span>!
      <!-- l. 15 --><p class='noindent'>We  are  social  creatures!  Even  while  working  in  abstract  fields  like
      mathematical or theoretical physics, we still remain emotional beings:
      we will be more motivated to learn something if we like our instructor,
      we will be eager to help our research partners if we are good friends
      with  them,  and  our  emotions  will  be  better  regulated  in  our  work
      environment if we feel <span class='cmti-12'>belonging there</span>.
      </p><!-- l. 17 --><p class='noindent'>This  is  vitally  important  during  your  graduate  studies  and  your
      postdoctoral years afterwards: if you are with <span class='cmti-12'>wrong </span>people, your life
      can turn into hell very quickly! Even though you always have the option
      to change your advisor afterwards, it is still a lot of hassle for you hence
      you should try to make this judgment before asking me to be your
      instructor.
      </p><!-- l. 19 --><p class='noindent'>Here are a few things that should help you make an educated judgment:
      </p>
           <ul class='itemize1'>
           <li class='itemize'>
           <!-- l. 21 --><p class='noindent'>I take academic integrity with <span class='cmti-12'>utmost importance</span>. I would like
           to emphasize this: I WOULD NOT TOLERATE ACADEMIC
           DISHONESTY!
           </p><!-- l. 23 --><p class='noindent'>My  apologies  for  this  somewhat  rude  tone,  but  unfortunately
           academic dishonesty is somewhat common in Turkey. METU is
           way above the average, but students are exposed to incorrect role
           models throughout their early lives, hence can even be oblivious
                                                                          

                                                                          
           to what is academically moral and what is not!
           </p><!-- l. 25 --><p class='noindent'>If  you  would  like  to  work  with  me,  please  first  read  <a href='https://soneralbayrak.com/teaching/AcademicIntegrity.html'>my
           explanations of the expected academic integrity</a>: if you do not
           fullheartedly agree with my points there, there is little chance that
           we could get along as mentor and mentee.
           </p></li>
           <li class='itemize'>
           <!-- l. 27 --><p class='noindent'>I take my work seriously. I will do my best to guide you, not only
           because I see this as my job but also because I genuinely care
           about potential young scientists (and how I could help them). But
           this also means that <span class='cmti-12'>I expect you to take our work seriously and
           </span><span class='cmti-12'>do your best to hone your skills</span>!
           </p><!-- l. 29 --><p class='noindent'>This  is  a  very  important  point  because  theoretical  physics  is
           a  really  abstract  realm  and  aiming  to  be  a  good  scientist  in
           this field is a genuinely challenging task! The main part of the
           challenge is our nature: we members of <span class='cmti-12'>Homo sapiens  </span>are tool
           using creatures, and are <span class='cmti-12'>evolved  </span>to use everything as tools for
           ourselves —knowledge is no exception. When we learn something
           new, our natural instinct is to find out where we can use it, or
           what it is good for. This is why seeing concrete examples help
           us  learn  something  better,  why  students  tend  to  study  for  an
           exam by solving similar questions, and why utility is an intrinsic
           motivation for almost everyone. Theoretical physics is bereft of
           this instinctual motivation.
           </p><!-- l. 31 --><p class='noindent'>What  is  my  point?  You  have  to  have  a  strong  resolve,  a
           genuine curiosity towards nature/math, and a strong willpower
           to keep working on this field. And only then, you can take our
           collaboration seriously enough to make the most of it!
           </p></li>
           <li class='itemize'>I  am  an  advocate  of  keeping  professional  relations  at  high
           standards:  I  will  do  my  best  to  be  punctual,  to  respect  your
           time, to avoid contacting you for work-related purposes during
           weekends and holidays, and so on. And <span class='cmti-12'>I expect you to observe
           </span><span class='cmti-12'>same professional customs</span>; if you rather prefer to have more casual
           interactions, then I am probably not the right advisor for your
           graduate studies.</li></ul>

      <!-- l. 38 --><p class='noindent'>It is vitally important that you fully understand what being a graduate
      student means and how much help or involvement you can actually expect
      from your advisor. Please, carefully read what follows.
      </p><!-- l. 40 --><p class='noindent'>Bluntly, I will have two roles as your advisor: <span class='cmbx-12'>(a) </span><span class='cmti-12'>your academic mentor</span>,
      <span class='cmbx-12'>(b) </span><span class='cmti-12'>your research collaborator</span>.
      </p><!-- l. 42 --><p class='noindent'>As your academic mentor, I will try to help you learn how research is done,
      what academic resources you should use, how you may want to plan a career
      for yourself, and so on. Although technically you are a student, I will rather
      see our relation as <span class='cmti-12'>mentor and mentee </span>since student-teacher relation has a
      connotation of a power structure. This means you have far more freedom
      and autonomy (especially compared to your undergraduate years), but also
      far more responsibility.
      </p><!-- l. 44 --><p class='noindent'>As your research collaborator, we are on a completely equal footing: we are
      two physicists collaborating on a project (which may/may not happen
      to be your first project). Optimistically, our project will lead to
      publications, but we may not have sufficient results for a publication
      either. Ultimately, whether a research project leads to a publication
      in a certain amount of time (or ever) depends on the real-world
      conditions: how much time the members can spend on that particular
      project, if someone else beats them to the punch, whether there
      are unexpected setbacks on the project, and so on. It is also quite
      common for a project to start without finishing, or with collaborators
      drifting apart and completing their research with other people. Your
      studies is not much different than the real world projects! If we start
      together and our research seems to stall, you <span class='cmti-12'>should </span>try to find other
      advisors! Conversely, if I decide that our collaboration seems to be
      insufficient for you to develop your skills to <span class='cmti-12'>rightfully </span>obtain your degree,
      then I will stop being your advisor (you will need to find a new
      one).

      you to be any different. Indeed, <a href='http://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en'>Registrar’s Office</a> and <a href='http://www.physics.metu.edu.tr/People/People#as'>Departments’

      what pitfalls you should avoid; for instance, receiving the letter grade “U”
      twice consecutively gets you dismissed from the program (see article 27/1).
      Another example would be the successful graduation condition for the PhD
      study: learning how to generate novel and new knowledge (and
      actually doing it) is the aim of doctoral studies everywhere around the
      world, including Middle East Technical University (see article 38/1 of
