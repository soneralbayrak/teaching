      is in English by the article 5/1 of <a href='https://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en/middle-east-technical-university-rules-and-regulations-governing-graduate-studies'>Regulations</a>). However, high energy
      and mathematical physics (and especially the branches that I work on)
      are very <span class='cmti-12'>dynamic </span>fields, meaning that a high volume of articles are
      constantly being published. Doing a M.S. studies with me will require
      you to read a lot of articles, something which would be rather heavy
      on you if your English is not on par.

      Thus, I highly advice you to check out <a href='https://arxiv.org/list/hep-th/new'>some articles in high energy
      theory</a> to see if you can easily follow them: it is perfectly okay not to
      be familiar with technical vocabulary (such as cohomology or moduli
      space), just make sure your inability to follow a paper (if any) has
      nothing to do with language!

<li class='enumerate' id='x2-1004x2'>
      <!-- l. 12 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmbx-12'>Make sure you really would like to work with me!</span><br class='newline' />It is of course important to work with someone who is proficient in their
      field, but what is even more important is to work with people that you
      can <span class='cmti-12'>get along with</span>!
      </p><!-- l. 15 --><p class='noindent'>We  are  social  creatures!  Even  while  working  in  abstract  fields  like
      mathematical or theoretical physics, we still remain emotional beings:
      we will be more motivated to learn something if we like our instructor,
      we will be eager to help our research partners if we are good friends
      with  them,  and  our  emotions  will  be  better  regulated  in  our  work
      environment if we feel <span class='cmti-12'>belonging there</span>.
      </p><!-- l. 17 --><p class='noindent'>This  will  be  vitally  important  during  your  PhD  studies  and  your
      postdoctoral years afterwards: if you are with <span class='cmti-12'>wrong </span>people, your life
      can turn into hell very quickly!
      </p><!-- l. 19 --><p class='noindent'>But how about master studies? Your M.S. studies have relatively less
      impact  on  your  academic  trajectory,  and  you  don’t  have  to  work
      with  me  afterwards  if  we  are  not  the  right  match  as  <span class='cmti-12'>mentor  and
      </span><span class='cmti-12'>mentee </span>—you don’t even have to choose the same branch of physics
      for your doctoral studies. Nevertheless, it is still loss of two years and
      of good research opportunities if this turns out to be the case later,
      so you should try to make this judgment before asking me to be your
                                                                          

                                                                          
      instructor.
      </p><!-- l. 21 --><p class='noindent'>Here are a few things that should help you make an educated judgment:
      </p>
           <ul class='itemize1'>
           <li class='itemize'>
           <!-- l. 23 --><p class='noindent'>I take academic integrity with <span class='cmti-12'>utmost importance</span>. I would like
           to emphasize this: I WOULD NOT TOLERATE ACADEMIC
           DISHONESTY!
           </p><!-- l. 25 --><p class='noindent'>My  apologies  for  this  somewhat  rude  tone,  but  unfortunately
           academic dishonesty is the norm in Turkey. METU is way above
           the average, but students are exposed to incorrect role models
           throughout  their  early  lives,  hence  are  even  oblivious  what  is
           academically moral and what is not!
           </p><!-- l. 27 --><p class='noindent'>If  you  would  like  to  work  with  me,  please  first  read  <a href='https://soneralbayrak.com/teaching/AcademicIntegrity.html'>my
           explanations of the expected academic integrity</a>: if you do not
           fullheartedly agree with my points there, there is little chance that
           we could get along as mentor and mentee.
           </p></li>
           <li class='itemize'>
           <!-- l. 29 --><p class='noindent'>I take my work seriously. I will do my best to guide you, not only
           because I see this as my job but also because I genuinely care
           about potential young scientists (and how I could help them). But
           this also means that <span class='cmti-12'>I expect you to take our work seriously and
           </span><span class='cmti-12'>do your best to hone your skills</span>!
           </p><!-- l. 31 --><p class='noindent'>This  is  a  very  important  point  because  theoretical  physics  is
           a  really  abstract  realm  and  aiming  to  be  a  good  scientist  in
           this field is a genuinely challenging task! The main part of the
           challenge is our nature: we members of <span class='cmti-12'>Homo sapiens  </span>are tool
           using creatures, and are <span class='cmti-12'>evolved  </span>to use everything as tools for
           ourselves —knowledge is no exception. When we learn something
           new, our natural instinct is to find out where we can use it, or
           what it is good for. This is why seeing concrete examples help
           us  learn  something  better,  why  students  tend  to  study  for  an
           exam by solving similar questions, and why utility is an intrinsic
           motivation for almost everyone. Theoretical physics is bereft of
           this instinctual motivation.
           </p><!-- l. 33 --><p class='noindent'>What  is  my  point?  You  have  to  have  a  strong  resolve,  a
           genuine curiosity towards nature/math, and a strong willpower
           to keep working on this field. And only then, you can take our
                                                                          

                                                                          
           collaboration seriously enough to make the most of it!
           </p></li>
           <li class='itemize'>I  am  an  advocate  of  keeping  professional  relations  at  high
           standards:  I  will  do  my  best  to  be  punctual,  to  respect  your
           time, to avoid contacting you for work-related purposes during
           weekends and holidays, and so on. And <span class='cmti-12'>I expect you to observe
           </span><span class='cmti-12'>same professional customs</span>; if you rather prefer to have more casual
           interactions, then I am probably not the right advisor for your
           graduate studies.</li></ul>

      <!-- l. 38 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmbx-12'>Please understand how I view graduate studies!</span>
      </p><!-- l. 40 --><p class='noindent'>It is vitally important that you fully understand what being a graduate
      student means and how much help or involvement you can actually expect
      from your advisor. Please, carefully read what follows.
      </p><!-- l. 42 --><p class='noindent'>Bluntly, I will have two roles as your advisor: <span class='cmbx-12'>(a) </span><span class='cmti-12'>your academic mentor</span>,
      <span class='cmbx-12'>(b) </span><span class='cmti-12'>your research collaborator</span>.
      </p><!-- l. 44 --><p class='noindent'>As your academic mentor, I will try to help you learn how research is done,
      what academic resources you should use, how you may want to plan a career
      plan for yourself, and so on. Although technically you are a student, I will
      rather see our relation as <span class='cmti-12'>mentor and mentee </span>since student-teacher relation
      has a connotation of a power structure. This means you have far more
      freedom and autonomy (especially compared to your undergraduate years),
      but also far more responsibility.
      </p><!-- l. 46 --><p class='noindent'>As your research collaborator, we are on a completely equal footing: we are
      two physicists collaborating on a project (which may/may not happen to be
      your first project). Optimistically, our project will lead to publications, but
      we may not have sufficient results for a publication either. Ultimately,
      whether a research project leads to a publication in a certain amount of
      time (or ever) depends on the real-world conditions: how much time
      the members can spend on that particular project, if someone else
      beat them to the punch, whether there are unexpected setbacks on
      the project, and so on. It is also quite common for a project to
      start without finishing, or with collaborators drifting apart and
      completing their research with other people. Your studies is not
      much different than the real world projects! If we start together and
                                                                          

                                                                          
      our research seem to stall, you <span class='cmti-12'>should </span>try to find other advisors!
      Conversely, if I decide that our collaboration seems to be insufficient for
      you to develop your skills to <span class='cmti-12'>rightfully </span>obtain your M.S. degree,
      then I will stop being your advisor (you will need to find a new
      one).

   My usual research makes good use of Mathematica; however, I’m perfectly
open to supervising a student through their master studies via a series of projects
that are free of Mathematica or any programming. At the end of the day, the
most important thing is that you find a topic that you enjoy working on! However,
for this to be efficient, we should be collaborating on a topic that can be easily
handled by pen and paper.
</p><!-- l. 75 --><p class='indent'>   As my projects tend to be rather mathematical, they are not appropriate for
your master studies; for instance, you would not want to try to integrate product
of bunch of Bessel functions by hand. Therefore, I expect you to find a topic (or
