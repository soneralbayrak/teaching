      and (2) the department Y allows you to take the course X.
      </li>
      <li class='itemize'><span class='cmbx-12'>When would I be on probation?</span><br class='newline' />If  your  CGPA  is  below  2.00  in  two  consecutive  semesters,  you  are
      qualified as a probation student.
      </li>
      <li class='itemize'><span class='cmbx-12'>Can I take the course X if I am on probation?</span><br class='newline' />If you have not taken X previously, then you can not take it while on
      probation!

      expectations: adaptation problems to the university, health concerns
      such as ADHD, difficulties in the personal life, etc. You need to develop
      a strategy based on the core reason of your subpar performance; as
      a rule of thumb, if you anticipate that those reasons (whatever they
      are) were temporary, then it may be a good idea to re-take previously
      passed courses (especially high credit courses with the grades DD or
      DC); if on the other hand you are not sure if they would persist, it
      is rather preferable to take fewer classes and aim to increase CGPA
      by targeting AA in those classes than to take more classes and risk a
      burn-out due to constant background stress.</li></ul>
