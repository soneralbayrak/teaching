   <h4 class='likesubsectionHead' id='what-you-should-know'><a id='x7-12000'></a>What you should know:</h4>
<!-- l. 123 --><p class='noindent'>Here is the summary of what I refer as the expectation of academic integrity:
         </p><blockquote class='quotation'>
      <!-- l. 125 --><p class='indent'>     <span class='cmti-12'>By choosing to be a student at METU, you acknowledge your
      </span><span class='cmti-12'>obligations regarding the code of ethics and core values of this
      </span><span class='cmti-12'>university!</span></p></blockquote>
<!-- l. 127 --><p class='noindent'>This is not necessarily a trivial statement: each and every student is entitled
to her/his own personal moral codes; for example, a student may find
it perfectly acceptable to submit the same homework for two different
courses —after all, she prepared the homework herself. Likewise, another
student may find it morally okay to use AI tools to prepare explanations
for a math homework, because he can argue that what really matters
is the solutions of the math questions and he did solve them himself.
The essense of the statement above comes into the picture here: <span class='cmbxti-10x-x-120'>at the
</span><span class='cmbxti-10x-x-120'>end of the day, the students are expected to abide by the core
</span><span class='cmbxti-10x-x-120'>values of METU for all their academic work, not by their own
</span><span class='cmbxti-10x-x-120'>moral judgements</span>; indeed, both students in the examples above are at
fault.
</p><!-- l. 129 --><p class='indent'>   Okay, so what are these core values? And can we assign meaning to these
values in an objective and/or scientific way? I’ll answer the first question below,
but the second one is beyond my expertise to answer: moral codes may be
converged on by any set of rational people, but another school of thought roughly
claims the opposite —morality intrinsically differs from age to age and culture
to culture. Just search “descriptive ethics vs normative ethics” if you
would like to learn more about this (or check out <a href='https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/'>Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy</a>). In any case, all you need to know as a student is this: <span class='cmbxti-10x-x-120'>By
</span><span class='cmbxti-10x-x-120'>being a student at METU, you are already assumed to accept
</span><span class='cmbxti-10x-x-120'>the existence of moral codes and the responsibility that they
</span><span class='cmbxti-10x-x-120'>entail!</span>
</p><!-- l. 131 --><p class='indent'>   You may naturally ask: is there any reason to abide by these rules, beyond the
fact that you have to because of the regulations? The short answer is yes: these
                                                                          

                                                                          
rules have evolved for the benefit of you and the academic community that you
are a part of! For one, a society in which your intellectual work could be freely
stolen simply diminishes any motivation or enthusiasm to produce such
work to being with! For another, any institution that rewards high grades
to a student without them putting the hard work will eventually have
graduates who are simply incapable in their fields. If you are interested to
learn more, there are abundant of international sources how and why
academic integrity rules are important (for instance, see <a href='https://catalog.yale.edu/undergraduate-regulations/regulations/academic-dishonesty/#category.name'>Yale College</a> or
<a href='https://college.uchicago.edu/student-services/academic-integrity-student-conduct'>University of Chicago</a>), but for our purposes, here is the key message:
<span class='cmbxti-10x-x-120'>regardless of the personal views of the student, any act of academic
</span><span class='cmbxti-10x-x-120'>dishonesty (as defined by METU) could lead to severe consequences </span>;
for instance, impersonating someone else in an exam is punishable by
two-semester suspension from the school (see <a href='https://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2023/02/20230209-1.htm'>Higher Education Law, Article
54(1)ç</a>).
</p><!-- l. 133 --><p class='indent'>   As written at the top, the code of ethics of METU can be read <a href='https://www.metu.edu.tr/code-ethics-core-values'>here</a>. Without
going into the details, let me list a few examples of academic dishonesty:
</p>
      <ul class='itemize1'>
      <li class='itemize'>Plagirism: <span class='cmti-12'>Presenting other people’s work as yours</span>
      </li>
      <li class='itemize'>Using a source without citing it
      </li>
      <li class='itemize'>Having someone else impersonate oneself in an exam</li></ul>
<!-- l. 139 --><p class='noindent'>You may find further details and more examples in the references I listed
above.
