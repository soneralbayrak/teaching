   I would love to do my best to tailor your learning experience to your needs; in
particular, if you have any special situation, please contact me to discuss further.
Such a situation may be <span class='cmti-12'>physical disability</span>, <span class='cmti-12'>learning disability</span>, <span class='cmti-12'>ADHD</span>, <span class='cmti-12'>chronic
</span><span class='cmti-12'>health issue</span>, <span class='cmti-12'>mental health condition</span>, <span class='cmti-12'>complications with a pregnancy</span>, <span class='cmti-12'>temporarily
</span><span class='cmti-12'>disabling injury or circumstance</span>, <span class='cmti-12'>upcoming surgery</span>, and else. Being a
mathematical physicist who is bound to teach math-heavy courses, I would
particularly advise that students contact me if they have <span class='cmti-12'>dyscalculia</span>, and advice
that they check if they have dyscalculia in case they suffer greatly in
mathematical courses.
</p><!-- l. 7 --><p class='indent'>   I usually do not require <a href='https://engelsiz.metu.edu.tr/en/letter-academic-accommodations'>The Letter for Academic Accommodation</a> for my
classes (please check with me first though) ; however other instructors may prefer
students to have this: please check the website of <a href='https://engelsiz.metu.edu.tr/en'>METU Disability Support Office</a>
(DSO) for further information.

<!-- l. 9 --><p class='noindent'><span class='likeparagraphHead' id='academic-integrity1'><a id='x11-75000'></a>Academic integrity:</span>
   You <span class='cmti-12'>accept by taking my class </span>that you will abide by the academic integrity
rules <span class='cmti-12'>within my class as well</span>. You should definitely read <a href='https://soneralbayrak.com/teaching/AcademicIntegrity.html'>my explanations of the
expected academic integrity</a>.
</p>
<!-- l. 12 --><p class='noindent'><span class='likeparagraphHead' id='language'><a id='x11-76000'></a>Language:</span>
   The medium of instruction in my classes is <span class='cmti-12'>English </span>(article 5/1 in
<a href='https://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en/middle-east-technical-university-rules-and-regulations-governing-undergraduate-studies'>Regulations</a>): you are of course free to use any language (Turkish, English,
Quenya, etc.) when interacting with the instructor <span class='cmti-12'>outside the classroom</span>, but
please do your best to stick to English <span class='cmti-12'>inside the classroom</span>!
</p>
<!-- l. 15 --><p class='noindent'><span class='likeparagraphHead' id='attendance'><a id='x11-77000'></a>Attendance:</span>
   Class attendance is mandatory by the <a href='https://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en/middle-east-technical-university-rules-and-regulations-governing-undergraduate-studies'>Regulations</a> (article 23/1). Although I
am personally against mandatory attendance, I would strongly advice it anyway:
these courses can get quite essential for the rest of your physics career and you
may not be able to learn everything by studying yourself! That said, your
                                                                          

                                                                          
attendance will not affect your grade.

      determine the conversion of <span class='cmti-12'>Score </span>to a <span class='cmti-12'>Letter Grade </span>at the end of the
      course: although there are various guidelines (say, assigning <span class='cmtt-12'>AA </span>to the

      I will use my judgment to determine the appropriate designations based
      on the overall class performance and the receptions of the exams by
      the class. For my grading strategy in past, check out <a href='https://soneralbayrak.com/teaching/MyGradingScheme'>my explanations
