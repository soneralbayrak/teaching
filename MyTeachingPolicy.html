   I would love to do my best to tailor your learning experience to your needs; in
parcicular, if you have any special situation, please contact me to discuss
further. Such a situation may be <span class='cmti-12'>physical disability</span>, <span class='cmti-12'>learning disability</span>,
<span class='cmti-12'>ADHD</span>, <span class='cmti-12'>chronic health issue</span>, <span class='cmti-12'>mental health condition</span>, <span class='cmti-12'>complications with a

else.
</p><!-- l. 4 --><p class='indent'>   I usually do not require <a href='https://engelsiz.metu.edu.tr/en/letter-academic-accommodations'>The Letter for Academic Accommodation</a> for my
classes (please check with me first though) ; however other instructors may prefer
students to have this: please check the website of <a href='https://engelsiz.metu.edu.tr/en'>METU Disability Support Office</a>

<!-- l. 8 --><p class='noindent'><span class='paragraphHead' id='academic-integrity1'><a id='x9-36000'></a><span class='cmbx-12'>Academic integrity:</span></span>
   You <span class='cmti-12'>accept by taking my class </span>that you will abide by the academic integrity
rules <span class='cmti-12'>within my class as well</span>. You should definitely read <a href='https://soneralbayrak.com/teaching/AcademicIntegrity.html'>my explanations of the
expected academic integrity</a>.
</p>
<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'><span class='paragraphHead' id='language'><a id='x9-37000'></a><span class='cmbx-12'>Language:</span></span>
   The medium of instruction in my classes is <span class='cmti-12'>English </span>(article 5/1 in
<a href='https://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en/middle-east-technical-university-rules-and-regulations-governing-undergraduate-studies'>Regulations</a>): you are of course free to use any language (Turkish, English,
Quenya, etc.) when interacting with the instructor <span class='cmti-12'>outside the classroom</span>, but
please do your best to stick to English <span class='cmti-12'>inside the classroom</span>!
</p>
<!-- l. 14 --><p class='noindent'><span class='paragraphHead' id='attendance'><a id='x9-38000'></a><span class='cmbx-12'>Attendance:</span></span>
   Class attendance is mandatory by the <a href='https://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en/middle-east-technical-university-rules-and-regulations-governing-undergraduate-studies'>Regulations</a> (article 23/1). Although I
am personally against mandatory attendance, I would strongly advice it anyway:
these courses can get quite essential for the rest of your physics career and you
may not be able to learn everything by studying yourself! That said, your
attendance will not affect your grade.

      determine the conversion of <span class='cmti-12'>Score </span>to a <span class='cmti-12'>Letter Grade </span>at the end of the
      course: although there are various guidelines (say, assigning <span class='cmtt-12'>AA </span>to the
      interval <!-- l. 21 --><math display='inline' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mn>90</mn> <mo class='MathClass-bin'>−</mo> <mn>100</mn></mrow></math>),
      I will use my judgment to determine the appropriate designations based
      on the overall class performance and the receptions of the exams by
      the class. For my grading strategy in past, check out <a href='https://soneralbayrak.com/teaching/MyGradingScheme'>my explanations

      <li class='itemize'>You are <span class='cmti-12'>not </span>entitled to a make-up examination without a valid medical
      report as an excuse for absenteeism in an examination. Nevertheless, I may
      (or may not) grant you one if I believe you have a sufficiently valid reason:
      contact me if you have such a situation (a family crisis, death of a relative,
      etc.).
      </li>
      <li class='itemize'>Make-up examination is harder than the corresponding regular exam by its
      nature: it may include more content and is usually conducted during the
      finals’ weeks. This is to ensure that a student does not get an unintended
      advantage by taking the make-up examination instead of the regular one, as
      they get more time for the exam than their peers in the class. Therefore, <span class='cmti-12'>it
      </span><span class='cmti-12'>is strategically unwise to try to get a make-up examination in an intend to
      </span><span class='cmti-12'>get higher grades</span>.</li></ul>
