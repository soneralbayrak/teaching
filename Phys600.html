      field, but what is even more important is to work with people that you
      can <span class='cmti-12'>get along with</span>!
      <!-- l. 15 --><p class='noindent'>We  are  social  creatures!  Even  while  working  in  abstract  fields  like
      mathematical or theoretical physics, we still remain emotional beings:
      we will be more motivated to learn something if we like our instructor,
      we will be eager to help our research partners if we are good friends
      with  them,  and  our  emotions  will  be  better  regulated  in  our  work
      environment if we feel <span class='cmti-12'>belonging there</span>.
      </p><!-- l. 17 --><p class='noindent'>This   is   vitally   important   during   your   PhD   studies   and   your
      postdoctoral years afterwards: if you are with <span class='cmti-12'>wrong </span>people, your life
      can turn into hell very quickly! Even though you always have the option
      to change your advisor afterwards, it is still a lot of hassle for you hence
      you should try to make this judgment before asking me to be your
      instructor.
      </p><!-- l. 19 --><p class='noindent'>Here are a few things that should help you make an educated judgment:
      </p>
           <ul class='itemize1'>
                                                                          

                                                                          
           <li class='itemize'>
           <!-- l. 21 --><p class='noindent'>I take academic integrity with <span class='cmti-12'>utmost importance</span>. I would like
           to emphasize this: I WOULD NOT TOLERATE ACADEMIC
           DISHONESTY!
           </p><!-- l. 23 --><p class='noindent'>My  apologies  for  this  somewhat  rude  tone,  but  unfortunately
           academic dishonesty is the norm in Turkey. METU is way above
           the average, but students are exposed to incorrect role models
           throughout  their  early  lives,  hence  are  even  oblivious  what  is
           academically moral and what is not!
           </p><!-- l. 25 --><p class='noindent'>If  you  would  like  to  work  with  me,  please  first  read  <a href='https://soneralbayrak.com/teaching/AcademicIntegrity.html'>my
           explanations of the expected academic integrity</a>: if you do not
           fullheartedly agree with my points there, there is little chance that
           we could get along as mentor and mentee.
           </p></li>
           <li class='itemize'>
           <!-- l. 27 --><p class='noindent'>I take my work seriously. I will do my best to guide you, not only
           because I see this as my job but also because I genuinely care
           about potential young scientists (and how I could help them). But
           this also means that <span class='cmti-12'>I expect you to take our work seriously and
           </span><span class='cmti-12'>do your best to hone your skills</span>!
           </p><!-- l. 29 --><p class='noindent'>This  is  a  very  important  point  because  theoretical  physics  is
           a  really  abstract  realm  and  aiming  to  be  a  good  scientist  in
           this field is a genuinely challenging task! The main part of the
           challenge is our nature: we members of <span class='cmti-12'>Homo sapiens  </span>are tool
           using creatures, and are <span class='cmti-12'>evolved  </span>to use everything as tools for
           ourselves —knowledge is no exception. When we learn something
           new, our natural instinct is to find out where we can use it, or
           what it is good for. This is why seeing concrete examples help
           us  learn  something  better,  why  students  tend  to  study  for  an
           exam by solving similar questions, and why utility is an intrinsic
           motivation for almost everyone. Theoretical physics is bereft of
           this instinctual motivation.
           </p><!-- l. 31 --><p class='noindent'>What  is  my  point?  You  have  to  have  a  strong  resolve,  a
           genuine curiosity towards nature/math, and a strong willpower
           to keep working on this field. And only then, you can take our
           collaboration seriously enough to make the most of it!

   3. </dt><dd class='enumerate-enumitem'><span class='cmbx-12'>Please understand how I view graduate studies!</span>
      <!-- l. 38 --><p class='noindent'>It is vitally important that you fully understand what being a graduate
      student means and how much help or involvement you can actually expect
      from your advisor. Please, carefully read what follows.
      </p><!-- l. 40 --><p class='noindent'>Bluntly, I will have two roles as your advisor: <span class='cmbx-12'>(a) </span><span class='cmti-12'>your academic mentor</span>,
      <span class='cmbx-12'>(b) </span><span class='cmti-12'>your research collaborator</span>.
      </p><!-- l. 42 --><p class='noindent'>As your academic mentor, I will try to help you learn how research is done,
      what academic resources you should use, how you may want to plan a career
      plan for yourself, and so on. Although technically you are a student, I will
      rather see our relation as <span class='cmti-12'>mentor and mentee </span>since student-teacher relation
      has a connotation of a power structure. This means you have far more
      freedom and autonomy (especially compared to your undergraduate years),
      but also far more responsibility.
      </p><!-- l. 44 --><p class='noindent'>As your research collaborator, we are on a completely equal footing: we are
      two physicists collaborating on a project (which may/may not happen to be
      your first project). Optimistically, our project will lead to publications, but
      we may not have sufficient results for a publication either. Ultimately,
      whether a research project leads to a publication in a certain amount of
      time (or ever) depends on the real-world conditions: how much time
      the members can spend on that particular project, if someone else
      beats them to the punch, whether there are unexpected setbacks on
      the project, and so on. It is also quite common for a project to
      start without finishing, or with collaborators drifting apart and
      completing their research with other people. Your studies is not
      much different than the real world projects! If we start together and
      our research seems to stall, you <span class='cmti-12'>should </span>try to find other advisors!
      Conversely, if I decide that our collaboration seems to be insufficient for
      you to develop your skills to <span class='cmti-12'>rightfully </span>obtain your Ph.D. degree,
      then I will stop being your advisor (you will need to find a new
      one).

      <!-- l. 55 --><p class='noindent'>Unlike B.S. or M.S. studies, Ph.D. actually requires you to generate novel
      and new knowledge: learning how to do this (and actually doing it) is the

      Technical University (see article 38/1 of <a href='https://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en/middle-east-technical-university-rules-and-regulations-governing-graduate-studies'>Regulations</a>). If you would like

      Mathematica!
      </p><!-- l. 57 --><p class='noindent'>The fields I am specialized in make great use of computer aided computations;
      this is actually true for most of the formal physics. Indeed, if you would like
      to, say, expand in the eigenfunctions of a quadratic casimir and then do a
      harmonic analysis with that, you need to do symbolic computations
      involving highly specialized functions (Gegenbauer, Bessel, Hypergeometric

      </p><!-- l. 59 --><p class='noindent'>Do you <span class='cmti-12'>have to </span>know Mathematica for these projects? Well, no, you can still
      do them with pen and paper, but that is extremely inefficient. And even if
      you are okay with this, you should find yourself another advisor: I choose
      not to collaborate in a highly mathematical project where all of the
      computations are done by hand.
