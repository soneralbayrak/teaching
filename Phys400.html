      <!-- l. 13 --><p class='noindent'>Informally, this course is an opportunity to see how research is done in
      theoretical physics. Unlike other courses in the undergraduate curriculum,
      this course (by its nature) is closer to a <span class='cmti-12'>research environment </span>than a <span class='cmti-12'>school
      </span><span class='cmti-12'>environment</span>: you have far more control over the contents and pace of this
      course, but also far more responsibility regarding the outcomes. Hence, it
      will provide you with some valuable experience before your research-oriented
      graduate studies begin.
      </p></dd><dt class='enumerate-enumitem'>
   2. </dt><dd class='enumerate-enumitem'><span class='cmbx-12'>Make sure you really would like to work with me!</span><br class='newline' />It is of course important to work with someone who is proficient in their
      field, but what is even more important is to work with people that you can
      <span class='cmti-12'>get along with</span>!
      <!-- l. 18 --><p class='noindent'>We are social creatures! Even while working in abstract fields like
      mathematical or theoretical physics, we still remain emotional beings: we
      will be more motivated to learn something if we like our instructor, we will
      be eager to help our research partners if we are good friends with them, and
      our emotions will be better regulated in our work environment if we feel
      <span class='cmti-12'>belonging there</span>.
      </p><!-- l. 20 --><p class='noindent'>This will be vitally important during your PhD studies and your
      postdoctoral years afterwards: if you are with <span class='cmti-12'>wrong </span>people, your life can
      turn into hell very quickly!
      </p><!-- l. 22 --><p class='noindent'>But how about Phys400? Luckily, this is only a one-semester course and you
      don’t have to work with me afterwards if we are not the right match as
      <span class='cmti-12'>mentor and mentee</span>. Nevertheless, it is still loss of a semester and of a
      good research opportunity if this turns out to be the case later, so
      you should try to make this judgment before asking me to be your
      instructor.
      </p><!-- l. 24 --><p class='noindent'>Here are a few things that should help you make an educated judgment:
      </p>
           <ul class='itemize1'>
           <li class='itemize'>
                                                                          

                                                                          
           <!-- l. 26 --><p class='noindent'>I take academic integrity with <span class='cmti-12'>utmost importance</span>. I would like
           to emphasize this: I WOULD NOT TOLERATE ACADEMIC
           DISHONESTY!
           </p><!-- l. 28 --><p class='noindent'>My  apologies  for  this  somewhat  rude  tone,  but  unfortunately
           academic dishonesty is the norm in Turkey. METU is way above
           the average, but students are exposed to incorrect role models
           throughout  their  early  lives,  hence  are  even  oblivious  what  is
           academically moral and what is not!
           </p><!-- l. 30 --><p class='noindent'>If  you  would  like  to  work  with  me,  please  first  read  <a href='https://soneralbayrak.com/teaching/AcademicIntegrity.html'>my
           explanations of the expected academic integrity</a>: if you do not
           fullheartedly agree with my points there, there is little chance that
           we could get along as mentor and mentee.
           </p></li>
           <li class='itemize'>
           <!-- l. 32 --><p class='noindent'>I take my work seriously. I will do my best to guide you, not only
           because I see this as my job but also because I genuinely care
           about potential young scientists (and how I could help them). But
           this also means that <span class='cmti-12'>I expect you to take this course seriously and
           </span><span class='cmti-12'>do your best to hone your skills</span>!
           </p><!-- l. 34 --><p class='noindent'>This  is  a  very  important  point  because  theoretical  physics  is
           a  really  abstract  realm  and  aiming  to  be  a  good  scientist  in
           this field is a genuinely challenging task! The main part of the
           challenge is our nature: we members of <span class='cmti-12'>Homo sapiens  </span>are tool
           using creatures, and are <span class='cmti-12'>evolved  </span>to use everything as tools for
           ourselves —knowledge is no exception. When we learn something
           new, our natural instinct is to find out where we can use it, or
           what it is good for. This is why seeing concrete examples help
           us  learn  something  better,  why  students  tend  to  study  for  an
           exam by solving similar questions, and why utility is an intrinsic
           motivation for almost everyone. Theoretical physics is bereft of
           this instinctual motivation.
           </p><!-- l. 36 --><p class='noindent'>What is my point? You have to have a strong resolve, a genuine
           curiosity towards nature/math, and a strong willpower to keep
           working on this field. And only then, you can take this course
           seriously enough to make the most of it!
           </p></li>
           <li class='itemize'>I  am  an  advocate  of  keeping  professional  relations  at  high
           standards:  I  will  do  my  best  to  be  punctual,  to  respect  your
                                                                          

                                                                          
           time, to avoid contacting you for work-related purposes during
           weekends and holidays, and so on. And <span class='cmti-12'>I expect you to observe
           </span><span class='cmti-12'>same professional customs</span>; if you rather prefer to have more casual
           interactions, then I am probably not the right instructor for your
           Phys400.</li></ul>
